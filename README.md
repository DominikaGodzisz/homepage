## Description
 <br/>

**Hello everyone,**

I created this project to practise my front-end development skills. 
I just wanted to introduce myself and practise what I've learned. I'm going to upgrade this website as long as my skiils will be improved.
For now I used BEM naming convention, lists, tables, addind hyperlinks, flexbox and some of ES6+ features.

And here I am
